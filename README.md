## 🛠️ Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Git
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps to Install
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_project.git
   cd my_project
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the main script:
```sh
python src/main.py
```

## 🧪 Running Tests
To run tests, execute:
```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
## ✅ Code Coverage

We use [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) to measure how much of our code is exercised by the tests. This helps ensure that our tests cover critical parts of the application.

### 1. Install Coverage

Install the coverage package via pip:

```bash
pip install coverage
```
### 2. Run Tests with Coverage
Run your tests and collect coverage data using the following command from your project's root directory:

```bash
coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests
```
### 3. Generate a Coverage Report
To display a text-based report in your terminal, run:

```bash
coverage report
```
To generate an HTML report that provides detailed coverage information, run:
```bash
coverage html
```
You can then open the generated htmlcov/index.html file in your browser to view the detailed report.

## 📚 Documentation

Our project documentation is generated using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), which supports automatic extraction of docstrings from our source code. This helps keep our API documentation up-to-date and provides detailed information on each module.

### Getting Started with Documentation

1. **Install Sphinx and Extensions**

   Install Sphinx along with the recommended extension for type hints:
   ```bash
   pip install sphinx sphinx-autodoc-typehints
   ```
2. **Initialize Sphinx (If Not Already Done)**

   If you haven't already configured Sphinx, navigate to the docs/ directory and run:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   sphinx-quickstart
   ```
   Answer the prompts to set up your documentation.

3. **Configure Sphinx**

   In the docs/conf.py file, add your source directory to the sys.path and enable the autodoc and napoleon extensions. For example:

   ```python
   import os
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../src'))

   extensions = [
      'sphinx.ext.autodoc',          # Automatically document API from docstrings
      'sphinx.ext.napoleon',         # Support for Google style and NumPy style docstrings
      'sphinx_autodoc_typehints',    # Better type hint support
   ]

   html_theme = 'alabaster'
   ```
4. **Generate the HTML Documentation**

   Build the documentation by running:

   ```bash
   make html
   ```
   This will create an HTML version of your docs in the docs/_build/html/ directory.

5. **View the Documentation**

   Open docs/_build/html/index.html in your browser to review your documentation.
